									<h4>Introduction</h4>
									<p>We are an online professionals’ directory platform.

										Our registered users (“Members”) share their professional identities, engage with their network, exchange knowledge and professional insights, post and view relevant content, and find business opportunities. Content on some of our services is also visible to unregistered viewers (“Visitors”). We believe that our services allow our Members to effectively compete and achieve their full potential. The cornerstone of our business is to focus on our Members first.
										We protect your personal information using industry-standard safeguards.
										
										We may share your information with your consent or as required by law, and we will always let you know when we make significant changes to this Privacy Policy.
										
										Maintaining your trust is our top priority, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>We protect your personal information and will only provide it to third parties: (1) with your consent; (2) where it is necessary to carry out your instructions; (3) as reasonably necessary in order to provide our features and functionality to you; (4) when we reasonably believe it is required by law, subpoena or other legal process; or (5) as necessary to enforce our User Agreement or protect the rights, property, or safety of Pro-Filr.com, our Members and Visitors, and the public</li>
											<li>We have implemented appropriate security safeguards designed to protect your information in accordance with industry standards</li>
										</ul>
									<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Pro-Filr.com and the mobile application, We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our Service, or by other means so that you may review the changes before you continue to use our Services. <b>If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Continuing to use our Services after we publish or communicate a notice about any changes to this Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the changes</b></p>
								</div>

									<h4>1.What information we collect</h4>
									<dl>
										<dt>1.1. Data Controllers</dt>
										<dd>Our Privacy Policy applies to any Member or Visitor. We collect information when you use our Services to offer you a personalized and relevant experience, including growing your network and enabling business opportunities.

											<p>The personal information provided to or collected by our Services is controlled by Pro-Filr Inc, 10 George St. North, Brampton. ON L6X 1R2 Canada in respective of your location.</p>
											
											<p><b>If you have any concern about providing information to us or having such information displayed on our Services or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should not become a Member, visit our websites, apps or otherwise use our Services</b>. If you have already registered, you can close your accounts. We collect your personal information in the following ways:</p></dd>
									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>1.2. Registration</dt>
										<dd>When you create an account with us, we collect information (including your name, email address, and password).

											
											
											<p>To create an account on Pro-Filr.com, you must provide us with at least your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password and agree to our User Agreement and this Privacy Policy, which governs how we treat your information. You may provide additional information during the registration flow (for example, your postal code, job title, and company) to help you build your profile and to provide you more customized services (for example: language-specific profile pages, updates, content, more relevant ads and opportunities). You understand that, by creating an account, we and others will be able to identify you by your Pro-Filr.com profile. We may also ask for your credit card details if you purchase certain additional services.</p></dd>
									</dl>

									<p>We're looking for someone with the creative spark, eye for illustration and design, passion for graphics and ability to produce high quality design collaterals end-to-end.</p>
									<dl>
										<dt>1.3. Profile Information</dt>
										<dd>We collect information when you fill out a profile. A complete Pro-Filr.com profile that includes professional details – like your job title, education, and skills – helps you get found by other people for opportunities.
											<p>After you create an account, you may choose to provide additional information on your Pro-Filr.com profile, such as descriptions of your skills, professional experience, and educational background. You can list honors, awards, professional affiliations, Group memberships, networking objectives, companies or individuals that you follow, and other information including content. Subject to the settings you choose, your connections may provide recommendations and endorsements of you. Providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from our Services by helping you express your professional identity; find other professionals, opportunities, and information; and help business opportunities find you. It also enables us to serve you ads and other relevant content on and off of our Services</p>
										</dd>
									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>1.4. Address Book and Other Services That Sync with Pro-Filr.com</dt>
										<dd>We collect information when you sync non-Pro-Filr.com content – like your email address book, mobile device contacts, or calendar – with your account. You can remove your address book and any other synced information whenever you like.
											<p>You may use our address book or “contacts” importer (or other similar features) to upload your address book into our Services. We store this information (including phone numbers) and use it to help you manage and leverage your contacts in connection with our Services. We also use this information to enhance your experience with our Services by helping you to grow your network by: identifying your contacts that are already Members of our Services; providing a template to send invitations on your behalf to your contacts that are not Members; and suggesting people you may know (even if not in your contacts) but are not yet connected with you on our Services (as we may infer from your shared connections or shared managers, employers, educational institutions and other such factors). We may also use this information to show you and other Members that you share the same uploaded contacts who may or may not be Members.</p>
											<p>Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another individual on our Service (a “connection”) or to join our Service to connect with you, that person may have access to your email address or, for SMS invitations, mobile number because it may be displayed in the invitation. After sending these invitations, we may also remind your invitees of your invitation on your behalf. Your Pro-Filr.com connections will also have access to your email address.</p>
											<p>We make other tools available to sync information with our Services, and may also develop additional features that allow Members to use their account in conjunction with other third-party services. For example, our mobile applications allow you to sync your device’s calendar, email and/or contacts apps with our Services to show you the Pro-Filr.com profiles of meeting attendees, email correspondents and/or your contacts.</p>
											<p>Another example are software tools that allow you to see our and other public information about the people you email or meet with and leverage our Services to help you gain insights from and grow your network. If you grant these products (mobile applications or our other Services that sync external email and calendar services, such as “Pro-Filr.com Links”) permission to access your email and calendar accounts, they will access and may store some of your email header and calendar history information. Our products that sync with external email services may also temporarily cache message content for performance reasons, in a way that is unreadable by us and our service providers</p>
											<p><b>Any information that you upload or sync with our Services is covered by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy. You can remove your information at your convenience</b> using the features we make available or in accordance with Section 3. You can remove your address book and any other synced information at any time.</p>
										</dd>
									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>1.5. Customer Service</dt>
										<dd>We collect information when you contact us for customer support.

										When you contact our customer support services (e.g. on our Help & Feedback), we may have to access your Intra-Mails, Groups/Forum and other contributions to our Services and collect the information we need to categorize your question, respond to it, and, if applicable, investigate any breach of our User Agreement or this Privacy Policy. We also use this information to track potential problems and trends and customize our support responses to better serve you. We do not use this information for advertising.
										</dd>
									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>1.6. Using the Pro-Filr.com Sites and Applications</dt>
										<dd>We collect information when you visit our Services (i.e. Pro-Filr.com), use our mobile applications, and interact with advertising on and off our Services
											<p>We collect information when you use (whether as a Member or a Visitor) our websites, applications, our platform technology (such as “Share on Pro-Filr.com” plugins for publishers) or other Services. For example, we collect information when you view or click on ads on and off our Services, perform a search, import your address book, join and participate in Groups/Forum, participate in polls, install one of our mobile applications. If you are logged in on Pro-Filr.com.com, or another Service or one of our cookies on your device identifies you, your usage information and the log data described in Section 1.10 of this policy, such as your IP address, will be associated by us with your account. Even if you’re not logged into a Service, we log information about devices used to access our Services, including IP address.</p> 
										</dd>

									<dl>
										<dt>1.7. Using Third-Party Services and Visiting Third-Party Sites</dt>
										<dd>We collect information when you use your account to sign in to other sites or services, and when you view web pages that include our plugins and cookies
											<p>You allow us to receive information when you use your account to log in to a third-party website or application. Also, when you visit a third-party site that embeds our social plugins (such as “Share on Pro-Filr.com” for publishers) we receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser. If you are logged in as a Member when you visit sites with our plugins, we use this information to recommend tailored content to you. We will use this information to personalize the functionality we provide on third-party sites, including providing you insights from your professional network and allowing you to share information with your network. Our retention of this data is addressed in Section 3.2. We may provide reports containing aggregated impression information to companies hosting our plugins and similar technologies to help them measure traffic to their websites, but no personal data.</p>
											<p>You also allow us to receive information about your visits and interaction with the sites and services of our partners that include our cookies and similar technologies, unless you opt out. If you are not a Member, we rely on the online terms between you and our partners</p>
										</dd>
									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>1.8. Cookies</dt>
										<dd>We use cookies and similar technologies to collect information
											<p>As described in our Cookie Policy, we use cookies and similar technologies, including mobile application identifiers, to help us recognize you across different Services, learn about your interests both on and off our Services, improve your experience, increase security, measure use and effectiveness of our Services, and serve advertising. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. By visiting our Services, you consent to the placement of cookies and beacons in your browser and HTML-based emails in accordance with this Privacy Policy, which incorporates by reference our Cookie Policy.</p>
										</dd>
									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>1.9. Advertising Technologies and Web Beacons</dt>
										<dd>We use advertising technologies and web beacons to collect information. We give you a number of ways to opt out of targeted ads, including through the Ad Choices icon shown with any ads we serve on third-party sites. If you do not want us to track your behavior on third-party sites, you can opt out. <b>If you do not opt out, you consent to our use of beacons and other advertising technologies.</b>
											<p>We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off of our Services through a variety of ad networks and ad exchanges, using the following, whether separately or combined:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Advertising technologies on and off of our Services, like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers as permitted by mobile platforms;</li>
												<li>Member-provided profile and contact information and categories (for example, “product managers in Texas”);</li>
												<li>Information inferred from a Member‘s profile (for example, using job titles to infer age, industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; or names to infer gender);</li>
												<li>Information from 3rd parties (e.g. advertising partners, publishers and data aggregators) which we use in addition to the information from our cookies (and similar technologies), your profile and use of our Services</li>
											</ul>
											<p>We do not share your personal information with any third-party advertisers or ad networks for advertising without your separate permission. Note that, as described in Section 2.6, your profile is visible to other Members and through public search depending on your settings. Also, advertising partners may associate personal information collected by the advertiser directly from you with our cookies and similar technologies. In such instances, we contractually require such advertisers to obtain your explicit opt-in consent before doing so</p>
											<p>We may show you sponsored content in your network update stream (NUS), which will be designated as sponsored content and will behave like other NUS updates. If you take social action (for example, if you “like” or “comment” on the sponsored content), your action may be seen by your network and other Members who are shown the sponsored content after you have acted on it.</p>
											<p>We adhere to self-regulatory principles for interest based advertising. If you wish to not receive targeted ads from most third party companies, you may opt-out as described here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads or targeted ads by companies not listed with these opt-out tools. You can also opt out specifically from our use of cookies and similar technologies to track your behavior on third party sites. For non-Members, this opt out setting is here</p>
										</dd>
									</dl>
									<dl>
											<dt>1.10. Log Files, IP Addresses, and Information About Your Computer and Mobile Device</dt>
											<dd>We collect information from the devices and networks that you use to access our Services.
												<p>When you visit or leave our Services (whether as a Member or Visitor) by clicking a hyperlink or when you view a third-party site that includes our plugin or cookies (or similar technology), we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came or the one to which you are directed. Also, advertisers receive the URL of the page that you are on when you click an ad on or through our Services. We also receive the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer or the proxy server that you use to access the web, your computer operating system details, your type of web browser, your mobile device (including your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device operating system), your mobile operating system (if you are accessing Pro-Filr.com using a mobile device), and the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We may also receive location data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have set up, which we use to show you local information on our mobile applications and for fraud prevention and security purposes. Most mobile devices allow you to prevent real time location data being sent to us, and of course we will honor your settings.</p>
												<p>in the case of our Android apps, you will be provided notice of the types of data (e.g. location) that will be sent to us. If you choose to use our app after this notice, we process this data to enable registration or preview product features for you (e.g. jobs near you). If you choose not to become a Member, we will delete this information</p>
											</dd>
									</dl>
									<dl>
											<dt>1.11. Other</dt>
											<dd>We are constantly innovating to improve our Services, which means we may create new ways to collect information on the Services.
												
												<p>Our Services are a dynamic, innovative environment, which means we are always seeking to improve the Services we offer you. We often introduce new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information (for example, Validation of Profile information, we began collecting information about skills for which Members were validated and the profile of individuals who validated them). Furthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information. If we start collecting substantially new types of personal information and materially change how we handle your data, we will modify this Privacy Policy and notify you in accordance with Section 4.3.</p>

									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>2.3. User Communications</dt>

										<p>Many communications that you initiate through our Services (for example, an invitation sent to a non-Member) will list your name and primary email address in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide the recipient with aggregate information about your network (for example, how many people are in your network). Other communications that you initiate through the Services, like a request for an introduction, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address contact information. Once you have connected with an individual, regardless of who sent the invitation, your contact information will be shared with that individual.</p>
										<p>We use automatic scanning technology to help protect you and other Members. Such technology checks links and other content in your Intra-Mails, network updates and Group contributions to help us identify and block malicious links and malware, reduce spam and optimize the delivery of our services</p>
									</dl>
									<dl>

										<p>We also customize your experience and the experiences of others on our Services. For example, when you sign in to your account, we may display the names and photos of new Members who have recently joined your network or recent updates from your connections and companies you follow. We try to show you content, such as news and presentations, that is relevant to you, your industry, or your profession. We also use Members information and content for invitations and communications promoting our Services that are tailored to the recipient</p>
									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>2.5. Sharing Information with Affiliates</dt>
										<dd>
											We share your information across our different Services, among companies in the Pro-Filr.com family.
										</dd>
										<P>We may share your personal information with our affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under common control with Pro-Filr.com) outside of the Pro-Filr.com entity that is your data controller (for example, Pro-Filr.com Inc. may share your information with Pro-Filr.com Limited, or other Pro-Filr.com operating entities) as reasonably necessary to provide the Services. You are consenting to this sharing.</P>
									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>2.6. Sharing Information with Third Parties</dt>
										<dd>Any information you put on your profile and any content you post on Pro-Filr.com may be seen by others.</dd>
										<p>We don’t provide any of your non-public information (like your email address) to third parties without your consent, unless required by law, or as described in Sections 2.6 and 2.14 of this Policy.

											Other people may find your Pro-Filr.com profile information through search engines (you can choose which parts of your public profile are accessible to public search engines in your settings), or use services like Twitter in conjunction with your Pro-Filr.com account.
											
											We offer a “public profile” feature that allows you as a Member to publish portions of your professional profile to the public Internet. This public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name. You may choose the parts of your profile that search engines index or completely opt out of this feature in your Pro-Filr.com account settings. However, third-party search engines may not automatically update their caches, which may contain old public profile information. Unless you delete them, your profiles on Pro-Filr.com and our corresponding app are always viewable on the respective Services.
											
											The visibility of your professional profile to other Members depends on your degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of the Services, access channels and search types (e.g. by name or by keyword). For example, first degree connections can see your full profile and contact information. Others have more limited access, as detailed in our Help Center. Please note that classic subscribers can see your full profile even if you did not approve their Intra-Mail.
											
											We do not rent or sell personal information that you have not posted on our Services, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not disclose personal information that is not published to your profile or generated through engagement with our other services, such as Groups/Forum and Company Pages, except to carry out your instructions (for example, to process payment information) or unless we have your separate consent, unless we have a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Privacy Policy or our User Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to Member service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of Pro-Filr.com, our Services, our Members, Visitors, or the public. See Section 2.14 for additional details about our compliance with legal requests for information.
											
											We support middleware providers that offer archiving solutions to firms subject to legal and regulatory archiving requirements, which, with your permission, facilitate the archiving of your communications and other activity by a third party for compliance purposes. Content distributed through our sharing features and third-party integrations may result in displaying some of your personal information outside of our Services. For example, when you post content to a Group that is open for public discussion, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results.
											
											Also, if you have opted to bind any of your Service accounts to your Twitter, Facebook or other similar account, you can easily share content from our Services to these third party services, in accordance with your account settings (which you may change at any time) and respective policies of these third parties. Further, we allow third parties to look-up profile information (subject to your privacy settings) using your email address or first and last name information through its profile API (see Section 2.7. below).
											
											Third parties (for example, your email provider) may give you the option to upload certain information in your contacts stored with us onto their own service. If you choose to share your contacts in this way, you will be granting your third party provider the right to store, access, disclose and use these contacts in the ways described in such third party's terms and privacy policy</p>
									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>2.7. Third Parties Using Pro-Filr.com Platform Services</dt>
										<dd>We work with developers to build Platform Applications using our developer tools. Whether you use Platform Applications is up to you.</dd>
										<p>f you have given a Platform Application access to your Pro-Filr.com account, you can revoke that permission anytime. Also, you can opt out of providing information to developers through your connections.</p>

											<p>We collaborate with and allow third parties to use our developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with our Services. These third-party developers have either negotiated an agreement to use our platform technology or have agreed to our self-service API and Plugin terms in order to build applications (“Platform Applications”). Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal information you provide to us.</p>
											
											<p>If you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third-party developer. To revoke permission granted to a Platform Application, please visit your settings. Note, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted to a Platform Application, your connections may still be using the Platform Application, so the Platform Application may still have access to certain information about you, just as your connections do. You may opt out of providing information to third-party developers through your connections by accessing the “Turn on/off data sharing with third-party applications” control in the “Groups/Forum, Companies, and Applications” tab under settings.</p>
									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>2.8. Polls and Surveys</dt>
										<dd>We conduct our own surveys and polls and also help third parties do this type of research. Your participation in surveys or polls is up to you. You may also opt out of getting invitations to participate in surveys.</dd>
										<p>Polls and Surveys may be conducted by us, Members, or third parties. Some third parties may target advertisements to you on the results page based on your answers in the poll. We or third parties may follow up with you via Intra-Mail regarding your participation unless you have opted out of receiving Intra-Mail messages. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires your contact information, you may be asked to provide personal information to the third party fulfilling the incentive offer, which will be used only for the purpose of delivering incentives and verifying your contact information. It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive. Your consent to use any personal information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it. You may opt out of participating in surveys by changing your settings to stop receiving these inquiries and requests.</p>

									<dl>
										<dt>2.9. Search</dt>
										<dd>Our Services help you search for other professionals, companies, Groups/Forum, professional content, and opportunities.</dd>
										<p>You can search for Members, business opportunities, information about companies, and community content from Groups/Forum on our Services. For example, you can find Members with particular expertise or experience, or Members that you may know from your industry or profession. You can also find business opportunities and information about companies. We use personal information from our Services, including Member profiles, Groups/Forum content, and Company Pages, to inform and refine our search service.</p>
									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>2.10. Groups/Forum</dt>
										<dd>You are responsible for any information you post on our Services, and this content will be accessible to others.</dd>

										<dd>ou can change your Pro-Filr.com information at any time by editing your profile, deleting content that you have posted, or by closing your account. You can also ask us for additional information we may have about your account.

											You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete your personal information controlled by Pro-Filr.com regarding your profile, (2) change or remove your content, and (3) close your account. You can request your personal information that is not viewable on your profile or readily accessible to you (for example, your IP access logs) through Pro-Filr.com‘s Help Center. If you close your account(s), your information will generally be removed from the Service within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information and will de-personalize any logs or other backup information through the deletion process within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.</dd>
											<p><b>Please note:</b>Information you have shared with others (for example, through Intra-Mail, network updates, content sharing, or Groups/Forum) or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile. Groups/Forum content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. In addition, you may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that other Members copied or exported out of our Services, because this information may not be in our control. Your public profile may be displayed in search engine results until the search engine refreshes its cache.</p>
									</dl>
									<dl>
										<dt>3.2. Data Retention</dt>
										<dd>We keep your information for as long as your account is active or as needed. For example, we may keep certain information even after you close your account if it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this agreement.

											We retain the personal information you provide while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you services. We may retain your personal information even after you have closed your account if retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes between Members, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement. We may retain personal information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement. Our Customer Service may retain information for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only, but we generally delete or de-personalize closed account data consistent with Section 3.1., except in the case of our plugin impression data (i.e., the information that you visited on sites carrying our social plugin, but which you did not click on), which we de-personalize within 7 days (although we do maintain 30 days worth of webserver logs for security, debugging, and site stability purposes only) by creating aggregate data sets that cannot be traced back to individuals.</dd>
